  <h2>Hi, I'm Holly</h2>

  <p>I'm a software developer with a love of Python and learning new things.</p>

  <p>I like programming and open source. I love Python for the language simplicity and welcoming community. I run Linux at home, open source all of my personal projects, and prefer to work at companies that support open source.</p>

  <p>I enjoy sharing my enthusiasm for Python and co-organize the <a href='https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Vancouver/'>Vancouver PyLadies</a> meetup group for women who program in Python, though it is open to everyone.</p>

  <p>I love playing games. My first love is board games, which I play frequently and regularly learn new ones. I dabble in tabletop RPGs and occasionally make time for video games.</p>

  <p>I love languages and writing systems.  I have been learning Japanese for a couple of years and consider myself intermediate level. I'm also casually learning Esperanto. In the past I've touched French and Arabic, though I have little skill with them now.</p>

  <p>I love to read, primarily for escapism. I love fantasy &amp; science fiction and like to share recommendations.</p>

  <p>I like birdwatching. It's the hobby I never thought I would like until it became an obsession, but now I almost always have binoculars with me. I love the challenge of finding and identifying new birds, as well as simply enjoying their beauty.</p>

  <p>I live in Burnaby, a suburb of Vancouver, BC. I like living in Canada, and Metro Vancouver is the only part of Canada that doesn't get too cold for me. However, I've also discovered the joy of travelling and love to attend science fiction, fantasy and gaming conventions, especially in far away places.</p>
