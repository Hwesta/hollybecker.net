    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi! I'm Holly, also known as Hwesta online.</p>

    <p>Professionally, I'm a backend web developer, primarily in Python and Ruby, and lately with more of a focus on databases. I have a particular fondness for Python because of the welcoming and diverse community.</p>

    <p>I enjoy a lot of hobbies, including reading, playing board games, language learning, birdwatching, and knitting.</p>

    <p>Most of my reading is fantasy and science fiction in all formats (ebook, audiobook and paper). I've voted in the Hugo Awards since 2015 and try to attend WorldCon when I can.</p>

    <p>I play a lot of board games, and I regularly have friends over to play. Mostly I enjoy 1-2 hour strategy games, though Spirit Island is a particular favourite. I play tabletop RPGs occasionally, and video games irregularly.</p>

    <p>I think languages, writing systems and linguistics are fascinating. I love to hear new accents or pick up on a bit of grammar that's unfamiliar to me. I'm learning Japanese (around N3) and I've dabbled in Esperanto, French and Arabic.</p>

    <p>Birdwatching is a hobby that I discovered as an adult that reshaped how I interact with the world, nature and climate change. I'm always happy to talk about good bird facts, or puzzle over the local gulls. More recently, I'm getting into tree identification - it's a slippery slope to an all-around naturalist!</p>

    <p>I picked up knitting on a whim, and within a year knit my first sweater. It's great to have a figet toy to keep me focused that also produces sweaters!</p>

    <p>I live in Vancouver, Canada, on the traditional and unceded lands of the Musqueam, Squamish, or Tsleil-Waututh peoples. I try to do one international trip per year, to see new birds and eat delicious food.</p>
