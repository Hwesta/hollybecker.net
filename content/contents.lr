Hi, I'm Holly, and welcome to my website!

I'm a backend end web developer with too many hobbies living in Vancouver, Canada. I read fantasy and science fiction, play board games, knit, go birdwatching, and try to find time for my Japanese studies.

This is a collection of things I've written or talked about. I hope you enjoy them!
