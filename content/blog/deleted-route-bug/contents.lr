title: deleted-route-bug
---
body:

Example:
took like a month of off and on work to discover a bug
problem was: route had been deleted from routes file during a refactor, not noticed
how did this happen?

2-4 systems talking
no observability
* couldn't see what errors existed
* no access to logs

no end to end testing
* nothing caught the deleted endpoint

system design
* error case (404 route not found) the same as expected case (no data/data exhausted also used 404)
